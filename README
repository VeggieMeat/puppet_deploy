This is another script I use with Jenkins. I run groups of Varnish, Nginx, and MySQL servers
that have configurations that depend on one another. Rather than have Jenkins tell those
servers to check in with the Puppet Master individually, I feed it a list of hostnames and
take advantage of Fabric's parallel execution to have them all update at once.

Of course, you can run it manually from the command line.

Be sure to change the user in the fabfile and the fabfile location in the shell script to
what you need.
